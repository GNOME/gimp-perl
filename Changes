Revision history for Gimp-Perl extension.

1.17  Wed Nov 24 21:25:19 CET 1999
        - re-fitted i18n translation for most plug-ins.
        - intllibs linking bugfix.
        - half-hearted attempt to i18nize logulator.
        - preliminary support for N_ (this function should
          not be necessary in perl).
        - used N_ to mark all the menu paths, since gimp now tries to
          do the translation.
        - patch by Frank Loemker <floemker@TechFak.Uni-Bielefeld.DE> to fix
          many missing :auto tags.

1.16  Sun Nov 21 02:37:16 CET 1999
	- removed sethspin.pl & billboard, they are no longer maintained :(
        - *sigh* removed some debugging code.
        - new save-filter "dataurl" (more a joke, but it does work).
        - new save filter colorhtml.
        - implemented gimp_pixel_rgn_get_row2 (others still unimplemented).
        - updated enums.pl.

1.15  Fri Nov 19 19:12:16 CET 1999
	- added italian translations by Daniele Medri (madrid@kjws.com).
        - POINTS really are decipoints: correct xlfd_size to create
          larger (& more correct) fonts.
        - small api changes for 1.2.
        - (some) changes for the gimp api renaming.
        - added export capabilities to miff/avi.
        - fixed "dirty" identifier clash with <= 5.005_03 && PERL_POLLUTE.
        - updated seth's scripts.
        - improved avi hunk skipping and 24 bit handling.
        - realclean now also removes the Makefile (just to be sure)
	- only install pdl plug-ins when pdl is available.
        - gimp_directory is 1.1-only.
        - more warnings on people insisting on using broken perls.
        - renamed init_gtk to gtk_init, asdded gtk_init_hook function to
          work around the horrible initialization problems in Gtk.
        - goto &name is horribly broken somewhere. going back to eval _again_.

1.14  Mon Oct 11 03:23:13 CEST 1999
	- set the version of all modules explicitly (for the benefit of CPAN).
	- added examples/avi (avi load/save plug-in, uncompressed 24 bit).
	- possible fix for another installation horror problem.
        - fixed a longstanding bug (?): not every class had a DESTROY, so
          the AUTOLOAD tried to resolve DESTROY after gimp_close had been
          called.
        - did the DESTROY catch differently...
        - fixed the testsuite.
        - started to revamp the extra argument handling.
        - updated PDB Explorer a bit, still broken.
        - almost full i18n of gimp-perl. A de translation is available.
        - save_image was kinda broken for jpeg and gif at least.
        - implemented more robust DESTROY and Lib:: connection handling.
        - put help window into a scrolledwindow, as to a suggestion by Jens
          Lauterbach. Karlsruhe rules!

1.13  Wed Sep  8 02:55:43 CEST 1999
	- removed some glib-1.1 compatibility cruft.
        - gimpdocs troff output did not include the description.
        - allow NULL strings in arrays to be returned as undef.
        - gimpdoc now outputs the menupath and other info as well.
        
1.12  Tue Aug 24 19:30:29 CEST 1999
	- do not emit warning for function names prefixed with "+".
        - removed non-c89 ansi'isms from Lib.xs.

1.11  Tue Aug  3 03:23:23 CEST 1999
	- EXPERIMENTALLY re-enabled the return path from main. It works
          with perl 5.005_60, but I remember problems with other versions.
          This re-enables END handlers etc.
	- updated seths scripts, added remove_guides...
        - examples/glowing_steel was missing from the MANIFEST!!
        - data types for RADIO, SPINNER etc.. are guessed better now.
        - added examples/guides_to_selection.
        - added examples/burst, without even looking at it ;)
        - warn about deprecated :auto behaviour, remove in next version.
        - call displays_flush in more cases now.
        - always leave a dummy dimension of 1 into the pdl, for gray and
          indexed drawables. down the other road lies madness.
        - implemented & added examples/map_to_gradient, needed for my next
          plug-in ;)
        - implemented & added examples/fire. I gained a bit of understanding
          now.
        - fixed a few bugs in Gimp::Fu. PF_PATTERN & friends confused the
          current with the default value and didn't restore it properly.
        - gimpdoc can now output a html file tree.
        - moved the Perl-Server and Perl Control Center into the Perl submenu.
        - Gimp::Parasite no longer has a search path.
        - Gimp::Data now handles data persistency.
        - Gimp::Fu augments (some) return value specifications.
        - fixed a "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" bug that was caused
          by passing undef for strings.
        - moved interact & friends into Gimp::UI.
        
1.1   Fri Jul 30 07:37:30 CEST 1999
	- one of the most successful releases, in terms of features & bugfixes.
        - it was also a long night. And expensive (irc).
        - renamed gimp_drawable_mask to gimp_drawable_bounds to avoid clashes.
	- new enums.pl, some changes: SELECTION_* becomes * again.
        - compatibility fix for 5.005_58, also fixed a bug in Gimp::Pod.
        - removed register_magic_load_handler from Lib.xs (is in PDB).
        - preliminary <Load> and <Save> support (arguments are automatically
          supplied).
        - enabled limited pixel access functions even when PDL was not found,
          just enough to re-enable magick and implement miff.
        - implemented and added examples/miff (a load/save filter for miff
          images).
        - close DATA in Gimp unconditionally, saves one open filehandle.
        - fixed the longstanding preview bug in Gimp::UI by reversing the
          order of calls to draw_row. => something in gtk+ is really broken.
        - fixed a longstanding (but never seen ;) bug in old_pdl: pdls that
          were not sever'ed created garbage.
        - allow dummy dimension in grayscale pdls, i.e. pdl(1,width,height)
          instead of pdl(width,height).
        - improved gimpdoc & pixelmap.
        - removed debugging code from gouge. ouch!
        - bug fixed: PDL::Core was not automatically required when not
          already loaded.
        - passing undef as PARAM_STRING passes a zero pointer in install_proc.
          Required for load handlers. Ugh.
        - fixed typoe in Parasite::is_persistent and implement "new" method.
        - added new convinience function to Gimp::Util.

1.0981 Wed Jul 28 00:09:50 CEST 1999
	- improved gouge ;) In a sense, it's actually pretty code now!
	- region functions (except data) wrongly returned transposed matrices.
          Now the order of dimensions is bpp <- width <- height.
        - implemented and added examples/gouge.
        - fixed warnings in case no pod documentation is found.
        - added examples/logulator.
        - Carp is no longer loaded unless necessary. Reduces memory footprint.
        - install embedxpm script by default.

1.098 Wed Jul 21 20:57:12 CEST 1999
	- do not try to compile gimp_personal_rc_file without gimp-1.1.
        - fixed old prefix detection.
        - get rid of "glib-config" dependency and use AM_PATH_GLIB instead.
        - do not install examples/magick until it is repeaired.

1.097 Wed Jul 14 22:55:24 CEST 1999
	- updated perlotine.
        - updated pixelmap with stub documentation.
        - redim_pdl calls affine_new directly rather than via the
          perl interpreter -> smaller Perl-Server, faster operation.
        - try to uninstall. Of course this doesn't work here, so just
          trust it will work elsewhere.
        - improved yinyang for the perl calendar ;)
        - added perl_fu_ as prefix for Image, Drawables and Channels.
        - fixed Load/Save of PF_TEXT.

1.096 Thu Jul  8 21:36:36 CEST 1999
	- fix around PDL-2.002 exporting its own ppport.h.

        - added Gimp::Fu::PF_TEXT.
        - added gimp_directory, gimp_data_directory and gimp_personal_rc_file.
        - added accelerator keys (escape and return) for Gimp::Fu::interact.

1.095 Tue Jun 29 01:22:01 CEST 1999
	- finally cut support for gimp-1.0.2 and gtk-1.0,
          fix the underscore confusion in Gimp/Net.pm.

1.094 Fri Jun 25 01:21:17 CEST 1999
	- finally(?) fixed the runmode confusion by making these constants
          magic. Also hopefully fixed the error message.
	- enable embedded pod sections in standard register arguments.
        - improved scm2perl ever so slightly.
        - fixed xpm off-by-one bug in embedxpm (and added embedxpm).

1.093 Tue Jun 15 21:48:48 CEST 1999
	- possible workaround for Gimp::Util::gimp_layer_get_position.
	- WRAP, SMEAR and BLACK were not being exported.
	- fixed small bug in pixelmap.
	- implemented gimp_query_procedure in XS.
	- scm2perl had broken cdr and cddr stubs...
        - fixed examples/font_table.
        - applied fixes from Lupe Christoph.
        - allow uppercase letters in hex colour specifications.
        - gimp_text_fontname ignored the image argument in
          compatibility mode (patch by Dov Grobgeld).
        - another solaris portability fix from Dov.
        - fixed xachshadows.

1.092 Wed Jun  2 14:52:29 CEST 1999
	- testsuite failed when !HAVE_PDL (and the whole package broke on
          systems with underpowered dynamic linkers).
        - gtk-1.0.x and gimp < 1.0.4 are no longer "officially" supported.
        - added COMPRESSION_*-constants for file_tiff.
        - added examples/pixelmap, needs doc!
        - probably fixed SIGPIPE problem in gimpdoc.
        - fixed pager bug in gimpdoc.
        - cleaned filehandle handling in Gimp/Net.pm.
        - streamlined config code again.
        - updated examples/parasite-editor, examples/mirrorsplit,
          examples/PDB.

        - added SvPV_nolen to ppport.h and made use of it everywhere.
        - renamed nolib => Module.
        - streamlined warning messages as not to scare the people away.
        - fixed a bug in check_for_typoe (correct TRUE and FALSE).
        - zero-copy piddle support should generally work now. Tile
          functions and network support is still missing, but...
        - experimental enhancements to the spawn/ hosttype.
        - Gimp::Feature no longer counts dos as unix-like.

1.089 Tue May 18 19:55:25 CEST 1999
	- added colourtoalpha.
	- made all internal C functions static -> less namespace bloat.
        - its possible to shorten the call $drawable->get->pixel_rgn
          to "just" $drawable->pixel_rgn.
        - made one-arg gimp_progress_init work again.
	- removed compatibility code from Lib.xs.
        - call the XS version of gimp_progress_init when only
          one argument is given.
        - re-added PARASITE_*-constants (including UNDOABLE variants).
        - temporarily disabled the module for political reasons.
        - made my first attempt at implementing XS-PDL support.
        - transform objects ids of -1 into undef and vice versa.
        - Gimp::Fu did not properly supply a default value for PF_COLOUR.

1.083 Wed May 12 03:36:10 CEST 1999
	- took a modified enums.pl to autogenerate constants. Some constants
          have changed:
          RED, GREEN etc.. => RED_LUT, GREEN_LUT
          the shear constants got a _SHEAR suffix.
          the flip constants got a _FLIP suffix.
          SHARPEN/BLUR => SHARPEN_CONVOLVE/...
        - got rid of _gimp_prefix and _gimp_path functions.
        - removed debugging trace from Gimp::Compat. Ugh.
        - improved documentation for Gimp::Config.
        - reenabled all of t/run.t again, fixed to to actually _work_.
        - rearranged gimp link flags into LDDLFLAGS (hack! bug in gtk/gimp!).
        - fixed RUN_FULLINTERACTIVE.
        
1.082 Tue May 11 19:02:30 CEST 1999
	- fixed sunos/solaris socketpair "protocol not implemented" problem.
        - added the Gimp::register_callback function and made Gimp::Fu use it.
        - made default font use pixels instead of point size, since gimp-1.1
          scales according to the image resolution(!).
        - disabled paintbrush in testsuite since it has different calling
          parameters in 1.1.
        - added use File::Basename to Fu.pm.
        - new module Gimp::Compat, which is loaded on demand.
        - gimp_text_fontname etc.. are now available in gimp-1.0 as well,
          re-enabled the scripts using it (and depending on 1.1 before).
        - allow negative "INT32's".
        - added examples/randomart1, the plug-in used in my iX article.
        - commandline switch printing improved a bit.
        - removed IO::Socket::* dependency from Perl-Server. Was tooo slow.
        - fixed uninitialized memory error.
        - some small improvements in PDB, gimpmagick and perlcc.

1.081 Thu May  6 19:33:37 CEST 1999
	- added "oneliners".
	- startet implementing Gimp::Module, for embedding perl directly into
	  the gimp.
	- added generic Gimp::Config module.
	- spit out a warning for unusual function names.
	- made Gimp->color_cube work.
	- added Gimp::init_gtk function to initialize Gtk in a Gimp-compatible
	  way.
	- replaced the default colour database by something far better ;)
	- exchanged order of some compiler commandline arguments.
	- improved Makefile support for embed.
        - added embed.
        - improved many parts of the build process.
        - updated ppport.h.
        - properly localized $_ in all subs.

1.08  Fri Apr  9 03:20:54 CEST 1999
	- added guidegrid, git-text, roundrectsel, repdup, centerguide,
          stampify, goldenmean, triangle, billboard, mirrorsplit.
        - improved error detection when some moron forgets to 'use strict'
          and tries to use undefined symbols.
        - added VALUE, RED, GREEN, BLUE constants for gimp_levels.
        - added WRAP, SMEAR, BLACK constants for plug_in_displace.

1.072 Sat Mar 27 21:04:39 CET 1999
	- scripts will now be correctly installed when IN_GIMP.
        - test-dir was not removed by make distclean etc.
        - messages now only show up in the Perl Control Center.
          this is not correct, however ;)

1.071 Tue Mar 23 13:47:10 CET 1999
	- changed the definition of PF_RADIO, simplifying it (it ain't no C).
        - Gimp::Fu scripts try to run with default arguments if Gtk is not
          available.
        - implemented PF_FILE, for selecting filesystem objects.
        - improved and fixed parasite support.
        - Gimp::Data now uses parasites when available.
        - changed FIXIN, i.e. all scripts now are patched with the correct
          bangpath.
        - added font_map. re-added xachshadow.pl, which was mysteriously
          missing.
        - fixed Gimp::Util::set_state.
        - improved get/set_state functions.
        - added perlotine, randomblends and innerbevel plugins.
        - improved t/run.t and server spawn robustness.

        - made the 5.004 + gimp-1.0 combination work by working around another
          bug in 5.004.
        - fixed reporting of errors at startup time.
        - enforcing argument name style. Eat it or die!

1.07  Mon Mar 15 01:27:05 CET 1999
	- added examples/yinyang, examples/image_tile, examples/stamps.
        - bangpath is no longer updated inplace. As a result, only plug-ins
          that are going to get installed are being fixed, the examples are
          not.
	- fixed error handling bugs in Gimp::Lib, streamlined and improved 
	  error handling.
	- reworked callback handling, should be more flexible in the future.
        - changed implementation of PF_CUSTOM (still untested).
        - fixed some rather scientific memory leaks, fixed more bugs.
        - the case when "not enough arguments" were supplied for a function
          was not reliably detected.
        - gimp_progress_init now accepts either one or two arguments.
        - switched to using Devel::PPPort, which hopefulyl solves all my
          problems.
        - argh! gimptool path was wrong again! the fixed version should be much
          faster as well.
        - new module Gimp::Pod.
        - embedded pod documentation will now be shown when the Help button
          is pressed (see image_tile for an example).
        - new evaluation function that evaluates a string as perl code, but
          does so on the server side. (Gimp->server_eval(string)).

1.061 Fri Mar 12 21:27:26 CET 1999
	- closed big, BIG security hole on password authenticitation
	  (basically one could do anything includung killing your
	  system without authorization. argh). This required a
	  protocol change, so old clients are unable to connect using
	  password-authenticitation.
	- sped up Gimp::Net considerably, by getting rid of the IO::Socket
	  module, which required half a second(!!) to load.
	- fixed Gimp::Util::gimp_image_layertype.
	- make install checks for install directory writability and refuses to
	  install if it isn't.
	- fixed a longstanding bug that caused (some) set_trace calls
	  to be ignored when running under Gimp::Net.
	- added new convinience functions to Gimp::Util.
	- Gimp::Fu checks for the presence of Gtk and dies if it can't be
	  found.
	- PF_FONT should now display a string widget in gtk+ 1.0.
	- PixelRgn/Tile data sould now be accessible again.
	- updated PDB.
	- extensive tests is now always on.
	- added examples/gimpmagick, examples/sethspin.pl, animate_cells.
	- new function Gimp::initialized that returns true whenever its
	  safe to call gimp functins.
	- added the Gimp::Feature module, allowing for easy feature checks.
	  See examples/gimpmagick or examples/parasite-editor for example
	  usage.
	- added perlcc, the perl control center. Only displays log messages
	  at the moment.
	- error and warning logging through the Perl Control Center.
	- Data::Dumper is now longer required to run the scripts, some
	  buttons and RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS won't work, though.
	- removed POSIX dependency in examples/gimpmagick.
	- Uh, ah, debugging code in the repository, again!

1.06  Sat Mar  6 19:36:12 CET 1999
	- Gimp::Fu does no longer display the returned image when it
	  is the same as the one passed in.
	- append imagenumber to "Untitled"-images in widget.
	- removed publicly-visible non-PDB pixelfunctions.
	  "uuuuuse peedee-ell or dieieie".
	- implemented Gimp::Fu::PF_RADIO.
	- added blowinout.pl, terral_text and xachvision.pl.
	- the use of Gimp::PDL to access the region/tile functions is
	  now mandatory. The old string interface does not exist anymore.
	- the path to the server-socket now includes the UID, to avoid
	  collisions. CGI-scripts should use either tcp or specify the path
	  directly using GIMP_HOST (see Gimp::Net for details).
	- use _much_ saner defaults for the Scale types in Gimp::Fu.
	- Gimp::Fu's optionmenus didn't work in net()-mode.
	- implemented PF_CUSTOM (untested).
	- added Gimp::UI::ColorSelectbutton, I was utterly fed up with
	  GtkColorSelectbutton never working.
	
1.055 Mon Feb 22 22:38:44 CET 1999
	- applied seth's script changes.
	- gimp11ified some plug-ins.
	- removed debugging code in Gimp/Lib.xs.
	- got rid of a perl5.004 warning.
	- removed gimp_{main,init,end}.

1.054 Mon Feb 22 15:23:41 CET 1999
	- scm2scm and scm2perl will now be installed in INST_SCRIPT
	- fixed a bug in interact/PF_FONT.
	- made save_image more 1.1 compatible and automatically index
	  when saving to gif.
	- many, Many, MANY 5.004 compatibility fixes.

1.053 Mon Feb 15 01:35:04 CET 1999
	- more errornous argument types are detected now, without
	  just calling abort().
	- fixed a MAJOR namespace-leak: for example, if one used
	  gimp_parasite_list once, Gimp::Image->parasite_list would call
	  gimp_parasite_list and NOT gimp_image_parasite_list, as would be
	  correct.
	- Gimp::Net now works correctly with parasites.
	- added examples/parasite_editor
	- added gimp_ prefix to Parasite-class
	- use $Config{perlpath} for bangpath, not $PERL

1.052 Tue Feb  9 18:16:15 CET 1999
	- moved the xlfd_size function from Gimp::Fu into Gimp
	  (and maybe later into Gimp::Util?)
	- functions in Gimp::Util are now treated in the same way
	  as PDB functions (when the module is loaded)
	- improved handling of "make clean" to make it less perl-ish
	  and more gnu-ish
	- enabled full testsuite (keep your fingers crossed)
	- PDL examples no longer cause errors at startup
	- more compatibility fixes for 5.005_54
	- bangpaths are now replaced by $PERL at configuration time
	- fixed a few quirks in scm2scm and added it to the package

1.051 Tue Jan 19 21:10:20 CET 1999
	- corrected a minor typoe found by Stefan Traby <stefan@sime.com>
	- added SPIRAL* constants for gimp_blend
	- moved constants from Gimp.xs and extradefs.h to Gimp.pm, where
	  they belong (either there or into Gimp.xs)
	- added view3d.pl to examples (untested)
	- Gimp::Util is reborn (give it a try and contribute!)
	- more Gtk changes (tested with Gtk-0.5 and gtk-1.1.x, uh-oh)
   	- faster startup by not loading Gtk by default ;)

1.05  Fri Dec 18 22:05:25 CET 1998
	- some 5.006 compatibility fixes
	- disabled some functionality for poor gtk-1.0 which
	  is borken to no end
	- fixed PARASITE_PERSISTENT typoe
	- new functions: gimp_{major,minor,micro}_version
	- PF_BRUSH, PATTERN and GRADIENT widgets are "emulated" in gimp-1.0

1.049 Mon Nov 23 20:54:41 CET 1998
	- updated configure to require 1.0.2
	- added some more scripts to the dist
	- brushes are no longer shown inverted
	- help button && logo for Gimp::Fu. the first doesn't work properly
	  and the second is ugly. feel free to send me a better version.
	- constants are no longer autoloaded (yeah!)
	- bug in Gimp::Net::set_connection fixed as suggested by
	  <alex@mediaconsult.com>

1.048 Fri Nov 13 20:39:52 CET 1998
	- Gimp::Fu::save_image now correctly respects the quality setting
	- allow layers/channels as drawables in typemap
	- allow usage of Gimp::PDL via Gimp::Net (this is a hack!)
	- added optional argument to gimp_init
	- fixed some of the example scripts for the "mega-api-break-it-all-
	  patch"
	- added Gimp::Net::get_connection and set_connection functions
	- the Perl-Server now respects GIMP_HOST and opens a socket
	  according to its content.

1.047 Wed Nov 11 02:47:12 CET 1998
	- passing arguments on the commandline works again
	  (formerly all arguments were treated as integers)
	- added the PDB extension to the distribution (alpha!)
	- added tex-to-float and alpha2color.pl plug-ins
	- fixed some memory leaks (the remaining ones are in the Gimp ;)

1.046 Thu Nov  5 01:53:34 CET 1998
	- the syntax really gets tricky - references to INT32 and similar
	  types are no longer accepted (was buggy anyway).
	- added plug_in_ prefix to layer, drawable, image and channel. We
	  can now write $layer->sharpen(50), and gimp infers function name,
	  run_mode and image
	- enhanced the testuite, it now checks much more features
	- gimp_end() now correctly closes the connection
	- implemented Gimp::lock and unlock functions, giving exclusive
	  access to the Perl-Server

1.045 Sun Nov  1 23:40:20 CET 1998
	- more configuration cleanups
	- fixed Gimp::Fu to respect RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS again
	- added more oo-prefixes to channels and layers (see Gimp::OO)
	- added preliminary gimp_init/gimp_end functions, see Gimp(3).
	- 'require 5.004_04' and added use base declarations
	- improved future compatibility
	- improved constant inlining
	- fixed a serious bug in argument handling when not all arguments
	  were given

1.0441 Sat Oct 24 22:52:05 CEST 1998
	- t/run.t does much less when no tests are requested
	- cleaned up Gimp::UI learned much about Gtk (but still not much)
	- an occurence of PARAM_PARASITE wasn't wrapped into an #if-clause.
	  this is just one of the countless braindead bugs being found
	  by schinder@pobox.com and the cpan-testers! Thanks!

1.044 Sat Oct 24 03:54:47 CEST 1998
	- allow PF_PATTERN etc. to be usable as commandline arguments
	- added parasite support -> untested so far
	- Gimp::Fu wasn't calling Gtk->init anymore
	- Gimp/Lib.xs wasn't including config.h, and nobody ever noticed ;)
	- we no longer link against ui-libraries, unless necessary.
	- added <5.005 warning
	- many, many configuration changes and hacks
	- this is now part of the gimp cvs tree
	- changed LIBS by LDLOADLIBS... hacky, but works
	- Gimp::Fu will no longer be traced
	- a run_mode argument at the beginning can now generally be left out
	- re-enabled the testsuite

1.0431 Thu Oct  8 20:01:32 CEST 1998
	- compile fix for gimp-1.0

1.043 Thu Oct  8 07:27:23 CEST 1998
	- allow <None> as menupath
	- added HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL
	- implemented PF_BRUSH, PF_PATTERN and PF_GRADIENT
	- examples/example-fu.pl shows all possible dialog widgets
	- fixed Gimp::Fu::xlfd_size to correctly return the pointsize
	  (rather than pointsize*10)
	- added FG_IMAGE_FILL (and fixed the values of the other FILL
	  constants, which were documented incorrectly)
	- please note that you can upload your perl-scripts to the
	  Gimp-registry now(!!!!). Visit http://registry.gimp.org/
	  and deposit your script ;)

1.042 Mon Oct  5 00:50:04 CEST 1998
	- implemented PF_ADJUSTMENT to aid scm2perl's job, its undocumented
	  and should not be used by new code.
	- fixed a coredump problem when tracing.
	- removed debugging code I accidently left in. Yuck Yuck!
	- an array size parameter in argument lists is now accepted and
	  silently ignored. This is for script-fu compatibility.
	- better error handling (I'm on the right track!)
	- added scm2perl (scheme to perl) to the distribution. Look at
	  "perldoc scm2perl". Needs Parse::RecDescent from CPAN.

1.041 Sat Oct  3 21:58:09 CEST 1998
	- a 5.004 compatibility fix. Another one and I'll simply "require
	  5.005".
	- Gimp::Fu doesn't display image and drawable widgets in commandline
	  mode unless the script really is an <Image>-type script.
	- Gimp::Net now passes colour values correctly (and also
	  undefs, which makes it slower but perl doesn't warn
	  anymore. argh.)
	- constants now have empty prototypes (so "RGB_IMAGE ? ... : ..." parses as
	  question operator rather than pattern match.
	- Gimp::Fu/Cancel button works in commandline mode

1.04  Thu Oct  1 22:42:57 CEST 1998
	- don't disallow drawable arguments as layer parameters.
	- fixed error reporting again (it should work now but still
	  compile with older perls ;)
	- implemented PF_FONT, see also Gimp::Fu::xlfd_size
	- implemented PF_SPINNER
	- another "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar" warning fixed

1.035 Wed Sep 30 23:58:02 CEST 1998
	- Gimp::ignore_functions can be used to ignore AUTOLOADING
	  of some functions. This is mainly for the benefit of interface
	  modules.
	- Gimp::Net/spawn will ignore gimp_progress_init and other, similar
	  gui dependent functions.
	- changed lookup order again to ease overwriting functions.
	- fixed the bug with not using the perl version of some functions
	  (like gimp_list_images)

1.034 Wed Sep 16 21:21:42 CEST 1998
	- various bugfixes in Gimp::Fu
	- added slider type to Gimp::Fu (PF_SLIDER), see webify.pl
	  for a demo.

1.033 Tue Sep 15 17:53:50 CEST 1998
	- added mailing list info to the README
	- compatibility fix for 5.004

1.032 Mon Sep 14 02:29:55 CEST 1998
	- Gimp::Fu now has (some) support for return values. I told you to
	  return undef ;)
	- fixed memory problem in Gimp::Lib when param array was empty.
	- removed bogus plug_in_ name prefix form the examples
	- don't install border.pl by default, gimp is just too buggy ;)
	- webify.pl now doesn't cut the layer away if the selection is empty.
	- added FG/BG buttons to fetch colours to Gimp::Fu (try Filters/Misc/Webify)
	- disabled intensive tests (batch mode now requires script-fu...
	  bleeech)

1.031 Sun Sep 13 21:50:51 CEST 1998
	- non-OO syntax works again (silly me) (and is no longer deprecated,
	  but the default!)
	- Gimp::function syntax officially does not work anymore. Use
	  Gimp->function syntax now (or use :auto)
	- made compatible with the newest gimp snapshit. wrote
	  lamentation to gimp-developers. commited suicide.
	- added examples/webify.pl
	- first try to implement return values in Gimp. Gimp::Fu still
	  lacks support.

1.03  Wed Sep  9 21:04:54 CEST 1998
	- all files are now readable/exec'able by group owner
	- updated some examples to the new syntax
	- small documentation changes (still waaay to go..)
	- Gimp::Fu now allows any string as colour specifier.
	- the Perl-Server doesn't eat the string "Gimp" as first argument
	  anymore, but still gimp_some_function("Gimp") is indistinguishable
	  from Gimp->gimp_some_function().
	- not use'ing Gimp from interface modules makes everything so much
	  easier..
	- fixed make clean
	- added more tests, including starting and testing The Gimp itself
	- passwords can now be used for the Perl-Server (and tcp is open
	  by default)

1.02  Wed Sep  2 23:35:37 CEST 1998
	- added Gimp::Patterns
	- Gimp::Fu now doesn't gratitiously share LAST_VALS with other
	  Gimp::Fu-plugins anymore ;)
	- reworked AUTOLOAD again, no it even seems to work.
	- fixed Fu::interact

1.01  Tue Sep  1 23:18:25 CEST 1998
	- PARAM_IMAGEs (et al.) can now be passed into an INT32ARRAY
	  (*shudder*)
	- arrays as return value now work. if a single array is being returned,
	  return it flat, else return it as reference (this does not include
	  colours, though)
	- INT8 values will now be returned UNSIGNED (!)
	- totally reworked autoloading, I hope its cleaner that way:
	  - Gimp is now a class like any other (Gimp::Layer, Palette)
	  - flat calling syntax is now deprecated ("gimp_image_new"),
	    OO-syntax should be used ("new Image" or "Gimp->image_new"),
	    which allows better compatibility.

1.005 Mon Aug 24 23:09:17 CEST 1998
1.004 (internal release for debian)
	- requires Gtk-0.3 now... since this version finally works,
	  I can code again:
	- added "Defaults" button to Gimp::Fu
	- prototypes enabled for pixel/region/pdl functions
	- various bugfixes to PDL functions

1.003 Sat Aug 15 21:06:41 CEST 1998
	- gimp-1.1 removes some functions, so don't prototype them.
	- a drawable first argument substitues for an image, i.e.
	  you can omit the first IMAGE
	- error reporting is now much better and reports the correct
	  source position, I hope ;)

1.002 Mon Jul 27 12:44:46 CEST 1998
	- Patch by Dov Grobgeld (default values for arguments, bugfixes)
	- gimp_displays_flush called always after a Fu-script

1.001 Sat Jul 25 04:01:55 CEST 1998
	- another fix by Aaron Sherman

1.0   Thu Jul 23 23:35:13 CEST 1998
	- prefix wrongly defaulted to /usr/local
	- other configuration changes
	- fixed(?) mod. of read-only variable...

0.996 Wed Jul 22 14:39:23 CEST 1998
	- greatly reduced code bloat, almost all functions
	  can be traced now, at expense of speed and possible
	  libgimp-bashing ;-<
	- _some_ plug-ins are installed by default now
	- if this surives the test, it will be 1.0. really.

0.995 Tue Jul 21 20:08:32 CEST 1998
	- do not depend on origargc and origargv anymore, as
	  these do not exist in perl5.004_76 (due to a bug, but
	  the new solution is better)
	- this is the release 1.0 candidate

0.994 Tue Jul 21 04:57:28 CEST 1998
	- check wether DIVIDE_MODE is available
	- commented out gimp_channel_get_show_masked
	  and gimp_channel_set_show_masked, since they are
	  implemented in gimp-1.0
	- implemented strings as colour specifiers, i.e.
	  gimp_palette_set_foreground "slategrey"
	  see Gimp::set_rgb_db

0.993 Tue Jul 21 04:38:01 CEST 1998
	- incorporated Dov's patch to enable --output
	  (man Gimp::Fu, save_image)

0.992 Thu Jul 16 17:10:46 CEST 1998
	- added more constants (see DIVIDE_MODE, gimp_color_balance)
	- Perl-Server now clears the trace result from the last command,
	  in case the command doesn't set it.

0.991 Thu Jul 15 19:00:50 CEST 1998
	- gimp_set/get_data now uses gimp_data_get_size when available
	  (the test will fail with some cpp's, though ...)

0.99  Tue Jul  7 03:23:07 CEST 1998
	- --info switch deleted from Fu
	- implemented --interact switch, default is now NOT
	  to interact when any script-arguments are given.
	- switched to using vi, instead of joe, for editing
	- killed configure, a Makefile.PL is now used (which
	  calls configure ;-)
	- got rid of the top-level configure, now use the Makefile.PL
	- implemented RUN_WITH_LAST_VALS in Fu, with hopefully useful
	  semantics. \0\0 is currently illegal in arguments, otherwise I had
	  required Data::Dumper or Storable

0.98  (not correctly issued)
	- 0.98 was wrongly issued to CPAN.

0.97  Tue Jun 30 19:36:23 CEST 1998
	- bugfixes, changes for gimp-1.1
	- Gtk-0.2.3 required

0.96  Sun Jun  7 16:24:46 CEST 1998
	- added windy.pl to the manifest.
	- Gimp::Tile & friends now work with Gimp::Net
	- Gimp::Fu now supports all PARAM_xxx-types
	- Gimp::Fu now supports some of the switches

0.95  Fri May 29 13:47:48 CEST 1998
	- thanks mr. libgimpui developer for this braindamaged "use static
	  structures" attitude. I reimplemented the libgimpui in perl.
	  not that it got worse...

0.94  Wed May 27 04:19:24 CEST 1998
	- PixelRgn and Tile manpages merged.
	- Gtk-0.2.2 required
	- Lib.xs (and _only_ Lib.xs!) now compiles & links against
	  gtk-config --whatever, since we need widget support.

0.93  Tue May 26 03:09:59 CEST 1998
	- documentation updates.
	- bugfixes.
	- added windy.pl plug-in.

0.92  Sat May 23 23:46:33 CEST 1998
	- preliminary GDrawable support (NOT Gimp::Net)
	- preliminary GTile support (NOT Gimp::Net)
	- preliminary GPixelRgn support (NOT Gimp::Net)
	- preliminary PDL support (in Gimp::PDL)
	- moved Gimp::OO into Gimp
	- bugfixes

0.91  Fri May 22 01:55:30 CEST 1998
	- Gimp::ColorSelectButton is no longer installed, Gtk-0.2.2 is
	  required.
	- commandline parameters supported
	- gimp_image_get_layers, gimp_image_get_cmap, gimp_image_get_channels
	  commented out, use pdb functions instead
	- fixed a bug in Fu handling of <Image> plug-ins

0.90  Tue May 12 15:26:50 CEST 1998
	- BUGFIX ONLY RELEASE
	- tracing works in Perl-Server (Oleg Bartunov)
	- fixes for Gtk-0.2.1
	- Gtk::ColorSelectButton renamed to Gimp::ColorSelectButton
	  until Gtk is fixed.
	- _I_ made the error of writing udp when I meant unix. _ARGH_

0.89  Mon May 11 03:29:30 CEST 1998
	- added common commandline options (--help, --host, --verbose)
	- help option for Gimp::Fu
	- added a whole bunch of --with-*= switches
	- well.... still more bugfixes!
	- Gimp::Net will autostart gimp

0.88  Wed May  6 17:00:57 CEST 1998
	- fixed "script-fu-whatever-garbage"->(arguments...)
	- renamed Net-Server to Perl-Server (why?)
	- more (untested) configuration changes. Does it work at all now?
	- removed Gimp::Util (it _was_ not convincing)
	- even more fixes
	- Gimp::Fu! including some documentation ;)
	- added Gtk/ColorSelectButton.pm

0.87  Mon Apr 27 15:38:23 CEST 1998
	- mainly a bugfix release, none of the new features work yet!
	- started to code Gimp::Fu for simple dialogs.
	- added more autoflush for old perls *sigh*
	- autoconf'd. not good, but its a start
	- AUTOLOAD is no longer exported, instead, @ISA is used

0.86  Thu Apr  2 19:59:06 CEST 1998
	- missing __STDC__VERSION__ only gives a warning now
	- got rid of alloca
	- added gimp_set_data & gimp_get_data
	- new module Gimp::Data

0.85  Fri Mar 27 17:43:35 CET 1998
	- compatibility autoflush added in Net-Server, better upgrade to 5.004_04
	- better signal handling in Net-Server... why does libgimp need SIGPIPE?
	- add -lglib to the libraries for Lib.xs, to cater for yet more broken systems

0.84  Fri Mar 13 21:23:07 CET 1998
	- calling "new Object" now actually works the second time.

0.83  Tue Feb 24 17:29:34 CET 1998
	- use strict always everywhere.
	- more errors fixed (by compiling under solaris ;), thanks
	  to dov@Orbotech.Co.IL for pointing it out!
	- change to support gnuc, c9x, and old (none) varargs macro syntax
	  could be done much easier, but I like the correct approach

0.82  Mon Feb 16 12:20:42 CET 1998
	- array types implemented... the gimp pdb wasn't thoughtfully
	  designed, or better: not _too_ thoughtfully.
	- network protocl changed (dunno why, not necessarily better..
	  also I was infected by versionitis (but Data::Dumper has the same
	  problem ;)))
	- floats are now displayed as such ;)

0.81  Sun Feb 15 20:57:53 CET 1998
	- tracing now works for networked scripts.
	- tcp supported in the server & client, but not enabled by default.
	- simplified Gimp::OO.pm
	- IO-syntax now support, i.e. new Image(..), which is still a hacky
	  namespace game

0.80  Fri Feb 13 17:15:48 CET 1998
	- version 1.0 is the first one generally usable.. we're getting
	  close!
	- Gimp::Net and Gimp::Lib are only internal modules, there is not
	  much of a distinction between networked modules and modules
	  using libgimp!
	- Gimp::OO usable over the network.

0.07  Thu Feb 12 06:51:56 CET 1998
	- some bugfixes, and the addition of Gimp::Net and an accompanying
	  server. See example-net.pl for a demo.

0.06  Wed Feb 11 02:42:24 CET 1998
	- the first user sent an example script ;)
	- PARAM_STRING's are now correctly displayed in traces
	- start of Gimp::Util, not very convincing
	- pseudo-oo interface, see Gimp::OO

0.05  Sat Feb  7 23:31:08 CET 1998
	- added set_trace and trace capabilities. helps to track down bugs in
	  pdb calls

0.04  Sat Feb  7 21:43:56 CET 1998
	- gimp_channel_set_color uses a d_color argument, like everybody else
	- libgimp functions will be used instead of pdb calls
	  wherever possible. libgimp functions using different calling
	  conventions than equivalent pdb functions (gimp_layer_copy, etc..)
	  are NOT exported.

0.03  Sat Feb  7 06:15:09 CET 1998
	- even more usable. although only pdb calls are implemented,
	  most gimp functions are available. dealing with tiles
	  directly in perl is probably too slow anyway (ha-ha ;)
	- the example plugin does slightly more now.

0.02  Sat Feb  7 04:18:17 CET 1998
	- first working version

0.01  Fri Feb  6 17:51:56 CET 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
