<Seth's random notes>
Convince someone that knows auto* to redo the compilation/installation.

Generate a new web presence for Gimp-Perl, with a friendlier face to it.

Easy commandline running of the server.

Get 'make test' working.

Add optional podviewer for help.  Add POD docs to all example scripts/documentation, to encourage good style.

Finish looking at all the examples and verify they work as expected or fix so they do.

Remove known broken examples from being installed immediately; remove from distribution eventually.  Remove unknown status examples from being installed eventually.

<Marc's previous stuff>
this is mostly my personal worksheet and notepad, which may not be
up-to-date and may not even be readable ;)

Put module under LGPL? 

/usr/app/lib/perl5/Gtk.pm:107 (method call -> goto)

gimpenv.c, gimpmodule.h, color_selector.h, color_display.h

po/Makefile
<Sven> schmorp: I think the makefile should have all (builds the pot-file and
      calls msgfmt if po-files have changed),
+update-po (merges all po-files), install, uninstall eventually

API generalization
   guide ->
   gimp_desaturate -> drawable

bugs
  STIFTUNG, FOUNDATION etc.. => ask.
  * URGENT: deinit might block... tis'is bad, but not close'ing is also bad
  * --enable-perl-prefix, --with-perl=, --with-perl-cc=
  * URGENT: podperl doesn't work.
  * try to work around the redhat-undef $fh => no close problem.
  * .pot file -> add to dist(???)
  * damnit libintl crazy shit
  * font_text with negative size? bug report #5523
  * gimp-perl list archives.. where and add this to the gimp.html page!
  * g_direct_equal and glin hash, kill in favour of way nicer perl hashes.
  * ping-funktion für JENS.
  * gtview_log (perlcc & helpfenster) erste zeile anzeigen + scrollbar
  * document on_xxx functions and register_callback
  * fix Gimp::Feature::missing => on_query-dir!
  * on-query => remove gimp::fu parasite(?)
[????]  * bricks requires disable for pattern(?)
  * installation & Feature system (?)
  * map_to_gradient does not work on GRAYA thingies. Argh.
  * document Gimp::PDL and rect2, ...2 functions!
  * Kommandozeilenmodus(!). (???)
  * gimp-piddle must be written back automatically on destroy, if changed
  * gimp-tile set dirty automatically(!)
  * create gimpstyle.pod
  
important issues

  * gimp_default_display -> undef when not available.
  * find_next_guide is a lousy interface. => just do num_guides
  * constant names (RADIO) automatically into help strings!
  * migrate BOOT: into INIT() (forgot why but important for B)
  * gimp_progress_done, gimp_progress_close
  * gimp_default_display (...) for libgimp
  * Gimp::Module for modules (!)
  * gimp for dummies (you don't understand this, harharhar!)
  * PerlCC configurable options for Perl-Server startup, Gipm_host etc.
  * implement CALLBACKS via the Perl-Server
  * PF_COORDS (just as Light Effects/FlareFX)
  * PF_PREVIEW(!)
  * Gimp::IO (?)
  * install scripts in share/
  * vamp up homepage
  * Gimp::ping
  * allow plug-ins to register with only a drawable argument(!)
  * gradient button
  * default parameters at end(!)
  * try to deduce default parameters

long term issues and ideas

  * rewrite interact() in pure C, gets rid of most gtk dependencies.
  * default function parameters (with hash %defaults?)
  * gimp_text(text => "hallo", family => "engraver", size => 20);
