* possibly reintroduce Gimp::Feature with GIMP 3 real release coming
* gimp-plugins-refresh: load is
  app/plug-in/gimppluginmanager.c:gimp_plug_in_manager_query_new, closedown
  is ./app/plug-in/gimppluginmanager.c:gimp_plug_in_manager_exit
  - issue with removing menus, probably stored in _plug_in data
  PDB call added in tools/pdbgen/pdb/gimp.pdb
* Progress bar in UI:
  - adding a Gimp::UI::ProgressBar;
* e/fade-alpha should generate buttons, not hardcode
* Gimp/Lib.xs is huge, and not very XS-y - lots of it is manually
  pushing GIMP data structures onto perl stack and vice versa. Figure
  way to pass GIMP data back and forth directly via typemap system. May
  involve a gimp-perl "wrapper" data structure that pairs an SV with its
  GimpParam counterpart - Gimp::Lib::Data?
  - maybe use FFI, which would help on Win32
* use Glib array for above
* Net.xs should implement own PDL serialise/deser. Use Lib.xs new_pdl?
* http://search.cpan.org/dist/Glib-Object-Introspection/
* Add Browse to console - plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-console.c
* interactive collab image-editing:

* Win32 port
* Figure out i18n some day.
