* Gimp/Lib.xs is huge, and not very XS-y - lots of it is manually
  pushing GIMP data structures onto perl stack and vice versa. Figure
  way to pass GIMP data back and forth directly via typemap system. May
  involve a gimp-perl "wrapper" data structure that pairs an SV with its
  GimpPDBArgType/GimpParamDef counterpart - Gimp::Lib::Data?
* gimp-perl website: maybe just gimp.org/glossary entry - only needs
  links to CPAN, bugzilla, git - make sure CPAN has all POD docs
  - https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/gimp-developer-list
  - https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=product:gimp-perl
* Get gimp PDL objects working right over Gimp::Net - infrastructure is there
* Restructure dirs so all libs under lib/ using ExtUtils::MakeMaker::BigHelper
* http://search.cpan.org/dist/Glib-Object-Introspection/
* Add a gtk2 gimp-perl console - cf http://registry.gimp.org/node/29348
  - gimp/plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-console.c
* Test menupath <File> etc
* "IGNORE THIS MESSAGE" - $in_top - what??
* die causes "Server-Warning" with duplicate exception message when
  Gimp::Fu in net mode dies. Gimp::_initialized_callback is sending
  @log to gimp_message and appending to 'gimp-perl-log' - don't see what
  benefit to either of those. Suspect _icb, logger, and PS flags are
  obsolete - replace with verbose
* set_trace may also be obsolete

Legacy notes from Seth Burgess:
* Win32 port
* Improve documentation quality - feedback desired!
* Figure out i18n some day.
