* possible killer app: https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gimp-developer-list/2014-April/msg00017.html
* <Load> and <Save> need any registration as such done in Gimp::Fu - see pod and e/dataurl
* Gimp::Fu no -o needs give warning
* Gimp::UI PF_IMAGE needs "open" button
* e/fade-alpha should generate buttons, not hardcode
* image in Gimp.pm POD http://perlmaven.com/how-to-add-images-to-cpan -
  input image -> output image of a plugin
* Gimp/Lib.xs is huge, and not very XS-y - lots of it is manually
  pushing GIMP data structures onto perl stack and vice versa. Figure
  way to pass GIMP data back and forth directly via typemap system. May
  involve a gimp-perl "wrapper" data structure that pairs an SV with its
  GimpParam counterpart - Gimp::Lib::Data?
* Get gimp PDL objects working right over Gimp::Net - infrastructure is there
* Restructure dirs so all libs under lib/ using ExtUtils::MakeMaker::BigHelper
* http://search.cpan.org/dist/Glib-Object-Introspection/
* Add a gtk2 gimp-perl console - cf http://registry.gimp.org/node/29348
  - gimp/plug-ins/script-fu/script-fu-console.c
* Test Gimp::Fu menupath <Load>/<Save>/<Image>/<Toolbox>/<None>
* "IGNORE THIS MESSAGE" - $in_top - whole quiet_die probably needs to go too
* PS flags are obsolete - replace with verbose - set_trace may also be obsolete
* interactive collab image-editing:

* Win32 port
* Figure out i18n some day.
