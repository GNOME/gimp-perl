=head1 NAME

  Gimp::Config - config options found during configure time.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Gimp::Config module creates a hash %Gimp::Config which contains
all the definitions found by the configuration process.  You can
access these values just like you access any other values, i.e.
C<$Gimp::Config{KEY}>. Some important keys are:

  IN_GIMP	=> true when gimp-perl was part of the Gimp distribution.
  GIMP		=> the path of the gimp executable
  prefix	=> the installation prefix
  bindir	=> paths where gimp binaries are installed
  gimpplugindir	=> the gimp plug-in directory (without the /plug-ins-suffix)
