This package is distributed under the same license as perl itself, i.e.
either the Artistic License (COPYING.Artistic) or the GPL (COPYING.GNU).

Please note that this does _NOT_ include the scripts in the examples/
directory. Most of them have their own distribution license (see their
source for details, and read the file examples/README).

If you make modifications, please consider sending them to me,
