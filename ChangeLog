2007-07-09  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* examples/glowing_steel: Changed previous fix. Check version number
	of GIMP to decide if extra parameter is needed. Applied the changes
	suggested by Spam Less. Fixes bug #310820.

2007-07-09  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* examples/glowing_steel: Removed extra parameter in call to mblur.

2007-03-26  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* Gimp/Compat.pm: Replaced xlfd_unpack() with a simpler version that
	actually works. Added the missing xlfd_size() routine.

	* Gimp/Fu.pm: Fixed some typographical and grammatical errors.
	Reminder: The notes about PF_FONT and what it returns needs updating.

2005-09-14  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.pm: Fixed up the various selection diaglogs; still has some 
	  brokeness I suspect is on the gimp side, and is VERY slow on the 
	  patterns.
	* Gimp.pm: Some more pseudoclasses
	* TODO: changed accordingly

	  getting; works again :)

2005-09-06  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/fade-alpha 
	* examples/dots: removed deprecated stuff, used Context        

2005-09-06  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Makefile.PL: require ExtUtils::Depends too. 

2005-09-06  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Makefile.PL: require ExtUtils::PkgConfig in order to avoid it failing 
	  in config.pl silently.  

2005-09-06  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Gimp.pm: add a Context pseudoclass.  Change first match for Layer 
	  pseudoclass to be gimp_drawable_ instead of gimp_layer_, because 
	  gimp_layer_* is largely deprecated now.
	* examples/billboard: use new Context pseudoclass, and other fix above.

2005-09-06  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* config.pl
	* Makefile.PL: no longer use autoconf (configure) to determine things; 
	  use ExtUtils::PkgConfig and gimptool instead.

	* Gimp/Lib.xs: have first parameter name checked for either "run_mode" 
	  or "run-mode" when deciding to automagically set the 
	  GIMP_RUN_NONINTERACTIVE (if not set otherwise).  Lets all the tests 
	  pass now!

2005-05-12  Carol Spears <carol@gimp.org>
	* examples/glowing_steel: changed deprecated pdb calls. 
	* examples/glowing_steel: even though Procedure Browser reports mblur 
	  needing only optional center_x and center_y FLOAT, it complains and 
	  stops unless it gets them.  I fed 0,0 to the script. 

2005-04-03  Carol Spears <carol@gimp.org>
	* examples/burst: changed deprecated pdb calls. 
	* examples/sethspin: changed deprecated pdb calls, including changing
          gimp-rotate to a much longer name that also wanted new information 
	  and in a different order.  removed the -1 to the progress_init to 
	  stop those pop-ups. 

2004-07-30  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Gimp/Lib.xs: fixup longstanding bug of not being able to 
	               use RUN_NONINTERACTIVE

	* Gimp/Fu.pm: bit of pod cleanup

2004-06-28  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.xs: fixed an XS error that shows up for GCC 2.95; 
          shouldn't create a temp variable in CODE: - put it in PREINIT:
          Reported by Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt <he@debian.org>.
          Fixed a typo in GradientSelect.
        
        * examples/burst: s/undo_push/undo
       

2004-04-17  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* updated TODO for suggestion in bug 117349

2004-04-17  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* added patch from Carol Spears, bug #100356.  Technically, this is
	  breaking the API after the release, but I really doubt many people
	  are calling colorhtml all that much.

2004-05-15  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Made 2.0 release.

        * Gimp.pm 
        * Changes: updated docs to reflect

          a bug if no selection was present. 

2004-05-15  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/selective_sharpen: use a curve suggested by tigert 
          to "Basically just darken the very dark noisy grays to black 
          and boost everything else."

2004-05-15  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/selective_sharpen: added new script based on tigert's 
	  method.
        * Makefile.PL: install it 
	* MANIFEST: updated accordingly

2004-05-15  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>

	* README.win32
	* TODO: updated to bring into line with current 2.0

	* examples/examples.TODO: removed scripts from here

	scm2scm from EXE_FILES, removed REC_DECENT warning.

        * Gimp.pm: reordered docuemntation, so that canonicalize_colour 
	doesn't come first on CPAN listing for GIMP.

        * examples/pixelmap: strip \n's from image title (prevent gui oddity)

	export functionality.
        * examples/ditherize: s/push_undo/undo/g
	* examples/example-fu: uncommented the now functional widgets for 
	gradient, brush, texture.  Added a couple other comments.
	* examples/example-net: commented
	* examples/example-oo:  use Gimp qw(:auto) important! Also,

	* exmaples/fade-alpha: put in the <Image>/Layer/Transparency menu 
	* examples/gouge: uncommented 2 registration strings.
	* examples/guides_to_selection: reworded description, so it will 
	hopefully be a bit more obvious what it does.
	* examples/iland: changed plug_in_rotate calls to work-around bug
	of not being able to call with RUN_NONINTERACTIVE
	* examples/parasite_editor: register as parasite viewer, since it
	can't edit yet.  Also fixed a Gtk2 problem (add_with_viewport).  I
	can't get this to do anything useful.
	* examples/scratches: s/VALUE_LUT/HISTOGRAM_VALUE/
	
	* Gimp.pm: previously neglected to rename VALUE_LUT in the subs; fixed.
	Added some more EXPORT_CAN_HANDLE*.
	* Gimp.xs: corresponding EXPORT_CAN_HANDLE* additions. 
	
 	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly + failures.  Now have 
	everything sorted into working and not working.

        * TODO: updated

	* Gimp/Util.pm: updated text_image_new for 2.0

2004-04-24  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* t/run.t: uncommented tests.  Recommented one that is still broken.
	Numbered the tests for easier reference, with brief description.
	Changed GIMP_DIRECTORY environment variable to GIMP2_DIRECTORY.
	'make test' should work now, along with other changes below.
	* Perl-Server: register as a PLUGIN rather than EXTENSION.  This
	is not only the right thing to do since it doesn't register temporary
	procedures, but also works around a bug in Gimp on loading extensions
	from the commandline with more than 0 arguments.
	* configure: changed search to gimp-2.0, require gimp-2.0

2004-04-04  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Net/Net.pm: removed some obsolete params being passed to gimp
	* t/run.t: commented out most of the tests.  Re-did a regex so it
	  actually will return a reasonable path for symlinking.

2004-03-29  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/yinyang: moved to Render at TomR's suggestion.

2004-03-28  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* examples/examples.TODO: Removed gimp-make-img-map, gallery,

	* examples/gallery: fixed
	* examples/yinyang: fixed
	* examples/gimp-make-img-map: fixed
	* examples/tex-to-float: fixed, erased various debug output

2004-3-28 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/Makefile.PL: removed pkg->add_define call, since its no longer in 
	Extutils::Depends 0.20x.  Need to generate another release for this, 
	since its a blocker for people installing (a somewhat-important step).   
2004-3-27 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* GIMP.pm: updated enums
	
	* examples/blended2: fixed, updated enums, removed 
	extraneous 'exit main'.

	* examples/translogo: moved to Web
	* examples/webify: s/push_group/push/

	* examples/fade-alpha

	* examples/randomart1: updated enums

	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly

2004-3-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Makefile.PL: don't install known broken plugins
	* TODO: split between Marc and Seth lists 
	* Gimp.pm: updated POD a bit to reflect a bit more reality
	
	* examples/fade-alpha: renamed registering to fade_alpha, fixed typos
        * examples/frame_filter: moved to Filters/Generic/ 
	* examples/pixelmap: moved to Filters/Generic/
	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly + can't use example-oo

2004-3-21 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>
	* configure: Quick fix to make it build with current gimp. Real fix 
	  is a lot more work, so punt for later.

2004-3-20 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* AUTHORS: added myself, didn't even attempt to list script authors
	* COPYING: changed Marc Lehman's address for modifications to mine
	* Changes: pre1 release, so something is available for Gimp2
	* NEWS: reflected ChangeLog format addition.
	* README: changed some typos; most things with gtk do work now; make
	  test could be broken, probably needs some attention; removed linux
	  plug (don't think its required any more).  Removed python reference.
	
	* Gimp/UI.pm: updated PF_TEXT for Gtk2 (stock buttons, sizing)
	  Also re-enabled help.  Want to use Gtk2::Podviewer if available
	  for the POD viewing portion, and fall back to Gimp::POD.
	* Gimp/Fu.pm: corrected description of PF_TEXT
	
	* examples/examples.TODO: tested pixelmap.  It needs more docs, but
	  works pretty well (uses PF_TEXT).

2004-3-08 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Gimp.pm: removed debug code
	
	* UI/UI.pm: made Gimp::Fu dialogs much more similar to 
	  script-fu in appearance.  Did away with "Previous" button, 
	  at least temporarily.  Help button is currently commented 
	  out, need to place it to right of blurb.  Removed FG/BG 
	  buttons (dragging works, so shouldn't be needed.  Made 
	  width adjustable, changed text/widget alignment.

	* examples/glowing_steel: s/bucket_fill/edit_bucket_fill 
	* examples/innerbevel: better defaults, better naming, removed debug
	  code, more fudging.
        * examples/warp-sharp: s/undo_push/undo/, added edge detect param
	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly

2004-2-29 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Gimp.pm: change canonicalize_color to detect and fix 0-255=>0-1.0 
	  problems for a reference passed in.  Still has lousy error detection.
	  Can hose up gimp's color selection pretty well.  Needs more testing.

 	* examples/fade-alpha
	* examples/innerbevel
	* examples/randomart1
	* examples/randomblends: s/blend/edit_blend to remove deprecated
	* examples/examples.TODO: changed appropropriately

2004-2-25 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Gimp/Util.pm: s/Gradient->get_active/Gradient->get_gradient/

        * examples/dust: removed deprecated stuff
	* examples/map_to_gradient: added param to get non-reversed gradient
	* examples/mirrorsplit: changed algorithm to add a layer; can't flip 
	  without it being added now.  Changed deprecated stuff.
	* examples/prep4gif: s/layer_set_visible/drawable_set_visible/

	* examples/examples.TODO: changed accordingly.

2004-2-25 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/bricks: brought up to date now that we have a pattern 
	selector.  Still has some work that could be done, but 
	functionality is restored.
	* examples/examples.TODO: changed accordingly.

2004-2-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.pm: Brushes are here too (grayscale only due to PDB limitation)

2004-2-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.pm: Gradients are back in!

2004-2-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/basewidget.pm: still needs to compile and return a value (for now) 
 	so stuff should work again.

2004-2-21 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/yinyang: s/gimp_bucket_fill/gimp_edit_bucket_fill/
	* examples/examples.TODO: updated appropriately

	* README: cleaned up a bit, relected personal biases of myself more
        * MANIFEST: added examples/dots
	* AUTHORS: gave myself some credit

	* Makefile.PL: reorganized examples into alphabetical order for eaiser
	maintenance, added dots.  Updated a potential error message or two.

2004-2-21 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.pm: Used Gtk2 to make PatternSelection work.  Stripped out the
	basewidget stuff.  Found that you cannot use the "Subclass" of Gtk2
	for implementing this, because of the dynamic loading (thanks muppet!).
	Selection dialog is still pretty ugly at this point, but it should 
	at least work.

	* UI/basewidget.pm: removed contents of file

2004-1-28 Marc Lehman <pcg@goof.com>
	* Gimp.pm, Fu.pm, Lib.pm, others: Upped version # to 2.0

2004-1-28 21:45:36 CET Marc Lehman <pcg@goof.com>
        * Changes, ChangeLog: Renamed Changes to ChangeLog, kept Changes
        to document revision history (because users likely will look at
        Changes to find which revision has which features).

2003-12-28 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.xs: add a call to gimp_stock_init() to UI startup, so we 
	get the gimp-* stock icons.  I'm not sure this is the proper way to
	do this, but it works... still not familiar enough with xs.

2003-12-26 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/glowing_steel: changed color specifiers to be 0-1.0

2003-12-24 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* UI/UI.pm: forgot this one.  
	Removed camel logo.  I don't want users to be aware of a difference.

	* I'm taking over maintainence of gimp-perl for now, knowing little
