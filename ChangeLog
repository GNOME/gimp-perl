	* UI/UI.pm: Gradients are back in!

2004-2-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/basewidget.pm: still needs to compile and return a value (for now) 
 	so stuff should work again.

2004-2-21 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/yinyang: s/gimp_bucket_fill/gimp_edit_bucket_fill/
	* examples/examples.TODO: updated appropriately

	* README: cleaned up a bit, relected personal biases of myself more
        * MANIFEST: added examples/dots
	* AUTHORS: gave myself some credit

	* Makefile.PL: reorganized examples into alphabetical order for eaiser
	maintenance, added dots.  Updated a potential error message or two.

2004-2-21 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.pm: Used Gtk2 to make PatternSelection work.  Stripped out the
	basewidget stuff.  Found that you cannot use the "Subclass" of Gtk2
	for implementing this, because of the dynamic loading (thanks muppet!).
	Selection dialog is still pretty ugly at this point, but it should 
	at least work.

	* UI/basewidget.pm: removed contents of file

2004-1-28 Marc Lehman <pcg@goof.com>
	* Gimp.pm, Fu.pm, Lib.pm, others: Upped version # to 2.0

        * Changes, ChangeLog: Renamed Changes to ChangeLog, kept Changes
        to document revision history (because users likely will look at
        Changes to find which revision has which features).

2003-12-28 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.xs: add a call to gimp_stock_init() to UI startup, so we 
	get the gimp-* stock icons.  I'm not sure this is the proper way to
	do this, but it works... still not familiar enough with xs.

2003-12-26 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/glowing_steel: changed color specifiers to be 0-1.0

2003-12-24 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* UI/UI.pm: forgot this one.  
	Removed camel logo.  I don't want users to be aware of a difference.

	* I'm taking over maintainence of gimp-perl for now, knowing little
	about perl packages or some of the deeper magick in gimp-perl.  
	Any assistance is appreciated.
	
	* Changes: This file will now be in a gimp-like Changelog format,
	that will record changes a little better than the previous method 
	(see below).

	                s/set_visible/drawable_set_visible/
	* Gimp/Lib.xs: s/drawable_image_id/drawable_get_image/
	* Gimp/Feature.pm: removed Gtk package references, replaced with Gtk2
	
	* examples/examples.TODO: added.  Keep track of testing of 
	scripts and plans for their futures.
