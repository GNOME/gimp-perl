	* examples/animate_cells:  s/channel_ops_duplicate/image_duplicate/
	* examples/billboard:  s/push_undo/undo/g
	* examples/clear_alpha: s/push_undo/undo/g (broken still)
	* examples/dataurl: Changed png to pass right # of parameters, changed 
	some deprecated functions, fixed some sub's in Gimp.xs for the 
	export functionality.
        * examples/ditherize: s/push_undo/undo/g
	* examples/example-fu: uncommented the now functional widgets for 
	gradient, brush, texture.  Added a couple other comments.
	* examples/example-net: commented
	* examples/example-oo:  use Gimp qw(:auto) important! Also, 
	register as a PLUGIN not an EXTENSION.  Works now!
	* exmaples/fade-alpha: put in the <Image>/Layer/Transparency menu 
	* examples/gouge: uncommented 2 registration strings.
	* examples/guides_to_selection: reworded description, so it will 
	hopefully be a bit more obvious what it does.
	* examples/iland: changed plug_in_rotate calls to work-around bug
	of not being able to call with RUN_NONINTERACTIVE
	* examples/parasite_editor: register as parasite viewer, since it
	can't edit yet.  Also fixed a Gtk2 problem (add_with_viewport).  I
	can't get this to do anything useful.
	* examples/scratches: s/VALUE_LUT/HISTOGRAM_VALUE/
	
	* Gimp.pm: previously neglected to rename VALUE_LUT in the subs; fixed.
	Added some more EXPORT_CAN_HANDLE*.
	* Gimp.xs: corresponding EXPORT_CAN_HANDLE* additions. 
	
 	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly + failures.  Now have 
	everything sorted into working and not working.

	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly

        * TODO: updated

	* Gimp/Util.pm: updated text_image_new for 2.0

2004-04-24  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* t/run.t: uncommented tests.  Recommented one that is still broken.
	Numbered the tests for easier reference, with brief description.
	Changed GIMP_DIRECTORY environment variable to GIMP2_DIRECTORY.
	'make test' should work now, along with other changes below.
	* Perl-Server: register as a PLUGIN rather than EXTENSION.  This
	is not only the right thing to do since it doesn't register temporary
	procedures, but also works around a bug in Gimp on loading extensions
	from the commandline with more than 0 arguments.
	* configure: changed search to gimp-2.0, require gimp-2.0

2004-04-04  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Net/Net.pm: removed some obsolete params being passed to gimp
	* t/run.t: commented out most of the tests.  Re-did a regex so it
	  actually will return a reasonable path for symlinking.

2004-03-29  Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/yinyang: moved to Render at TomR's suggestion.

2004-03-28  Dov Grobgeld  <dov@imagic.weizmann.ac.il>

	* examples/examples.TODO: Removed gimp-make-img-map, gallery,
	and stampify and gallery from untested section

	* examples/stampify: fixed
	* examples/gallery: fixed
	* examples/yinyang: fixed
	* examples/gimp-make-img-map: fixed
	* examples/tex-to-float: fixed, erased various debug output

2004-3-28 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/Makefile.PL: removed pkg->add_define call, since its no longer in 
	Extutils::Depends 0.20x.  Need to generate another release for this, 
	since its a blocker for people installing (a somewhat-important step).   
2004-3-27 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* GIMP.pm: updated enums
	
	* examples/blended2: fixed, updated enums, removed 
	extraneous 'exit main'.

	* examples/translogo: moved to Web
	* examples/webify: s/push_group/push/

	* examples/fade-alpha 
	* examples/innerbevel 
	* examples/randomart1: updated enums

	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly

2004-3-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Makefile.PL: don't install known broken plugins
	* TODO: split between Marc and Seth lists 
	* Gimp.pm: updated POD a bit to reflect a bit more reality
	
	* examples/fade-alpha: renamed registering to fade_alpha, fixed typos
        * examples/frame_filter: moved to Filters/Generic/ 
	* examples/pixelmap: moved to Filters/Generic/
	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly + can't use example-oo

2004-3-21 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>
	* configure: Quick fix to make it build with current gimp. Real fix 
	  is a lot more work, so punt for later.

2004-3-20 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* AUTHORS: added myself, didn't even attempt to list script authors
	* COPYING: changed Marc Lehman's address for modifications to mine
	* Changes: pre1 release, so something is available for Gimp2
	* NEWS: reflected ChangeLog format addition.
	* README: changed some typos; most things with gtk do work now; make
	  test could be broken, probably needs some attention; removed linux
	  plug (don't think its required any more).  Removed python reference.
	
	* Gimp/UI.pm: updated PF_TEXT for Gtk2 (stock buttons, sizing)
	  Also re-enabled help.  Want to use Gtk2::Podviewer if available
	  for the POD viewing portion, and fall back to Gimp::POD.
	* Gimp/Fu.pm: corrected description of PF_TEXT
	
	* examples/examples.TODO: tested pixelmap.  It needs more docs, but
	  works pretty well (uses PF_TEXT).

2004-3-08 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Gimp.pm: removed debug code
	
	* UI/UI.pm: made Gimp::Fu dialogs much more similar to 
	  script-fu in appearance.  Did away with "Previous" button, 
	  at least temporarily.  Help button is currently commented 
	  out, need to place it to right of blurb.  Removed FG/BG 
	  buttons (dragging works, so shouldn't be needed.  Made 
	  width adjustable, changed text/widget alignment.

	* examples/glowing_steel: s/bucket_fill/edit_bucket_fill 
	* examples/innerbevel: better defaults, better naming, removed debug
	  code, more fudging.
        * examples/warp-sharp: s/undo_push/undo/, added edge detect param
	* examples/examples.TODO: updated accordingly

2004-2-29 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Gimp.pm: change canonicalize_color to detect and fix 0-255=>0-1.0 
	  problems for a reference passed in.  Still has lousy error detection.
	  Can hose up gimp's color selection pretty well.  Needs more testing.

 	* examples/fade-alpha
	* examples/innerbevel
	* examples/randomart1
	* examples/randomblends: s/blend/edit_blend to remove deprecated
	* examples/examples.TODO: changed appropropriately

2004-2-25 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* Gimp/Util.pm: s/Gradient->get_active/Gradient->get_gradient/

        * examples/dust: removed deprecated stuff
	* examples/map_to_gradient: added param to get non-reversed gradient
	* examples/mirrorsplit: changed algorithm to add a layer; can't flip 
	  without it being added now.  Changed deprecated stuff.
	* examples/prep4gif: s/layer_set_visible/drawable_set_visible/

	* examples/examples.TODO: changed accordingly.

2004-2-25 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/bricks: brought up to date now that we have a pattern 
	selector.  Still has some work that could be done, but 
	functionality is restored.
	* examples/examples.TODO: changed accordingly.

2004-2-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.pm: Brushes are here too (grayscale only due to PDB limitation)

2004-2-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.pm: Gradients are back in!

2004-2-22 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/basewidget.pm: still needs to compile and return a value (for now) 
 	so stuff should work again.

2004-2-21 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/yinyang: s/gimp_bucket_fill/gimp_edit_bucket_fill/
	* examples/examples.TODO: updated appropriately

	* README: cleaned up a bit, relected personal biases of myself more
        * MANIFEST: added examples/dots
	* AUTHORS: gave myself some credit

	* Makefile.PL: reorganized examples into alphabetical order for eaiser
	maintenance, added dots.  Updated a potential error message or two.

2004-2-21 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.pm: Used Gtk2 to make PatternSelection work.  Stripped out the
	basewidget stuff.  Found that you cannot use the "Subclass" of Gtk2
	for implementing this, because of the dynamic loading (thanks muppet!).
	Selection dialog is still pretty ugly at this point, but it should 
	at least work.

	* UI/basewidget.pm: removed contents of file

2004-1-28 Marc Lehman <pcg@goof.com>
	* Gimp.pm, Fu.pm, Lib.pm, others: Upped version # to 2.0

2004-1-28 21:45:36 CET Marc Lehman <pcg@goof.com>
        * Changes, ChangeLog: Renamed Changes to ChangeLog, kept Changes
        to document revision history (because users likely will look at
        Changes to find which revision has which features).

2003-12-28 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* UI/UI.xs: add a call to gimp_stock_init() to UI startup, so we 
	get the gimp-* stock icons.  I'm not sure this is the proper way to
	do this, but it works... still not familiar enough with xs.

2003-12-26 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	* examples/glowing_steel: changed color specifiers to be 0-1.0

2003-12-24 Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
	
	* UI/UI.pm: forgot this one.  
	Removed camel logo.  I don't want users to be aware of a difference.

	* I'm taking over maintainence of gimp-perl for now, knowing little
	about perl packages or some of the deeper magick in gimp-perl.  
	Any assistance is appreciated.

	that will record changes a little better than the previous method

	* Gimp/Feature.pm: removed Gtk package references, replaced with Gtk2

	scripts and plans for their futures.
