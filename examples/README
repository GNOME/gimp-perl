This file describes the various files in the example/ directory. It also
contains links to applications/scripts people have written. If you
want to be added, drop me a note at <pcg@goof.com>

example-fu.pl
	a very small, bare-bones Gimp::Fu script. it is useful
	as a starting point for experiments.

webify.pl
	a small plugin that flattens an image, makes the background
	transparent, converts it to indexed and then crops it
	to the right size. Useful to save small & transparent gifs
	from a higher-quality source. It also features most
	Gimp::Fu UI-elements.

border.pl
	a "port" of the similarly named plug-in written in C, to
	demonstrate direct and fast pixel access. IT also differentiates
	between interactive and nonineractive use, and returns a colour
	value.

windy.pl
	this will windify your image. curious? well then ...

prep4gif.pl
	this will create a copy of your image prepared for saving
	as indexed gif. it will create a border around your image
	as well. I guess its for saving logos...

gimp-make-img-map
	"This program is an automatic way of scaling and tiling lots of
	images in order to create an index image."

homepage-logo.pl
	the very first gimp-perl script. I wanted to draw some buttons
	with script-fu and instead wrote a perl interface. It
	was probably faster to do it that way rather than using scheme ^_-

Create_Images/image_list
	this script takes a filename containing strings and
	sizes (look at image_list for an example), and writes
	.gif pictures with these strings into your /tmp

example-oo.pl
	a small nonsense extension just showing the object-oriented
	pdb syntax. its mostly obsoleted by example-fu.pl, since it doesn't
	use Gimp::Fu

example-net.pl
	a small nonsense extension showing a bare-bones networked script.
	this is obsoleted by Gimp::Fu
