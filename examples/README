This file describes a few of the many scripts in the examples/ directory. 

Some links of interest have been added to the bottom as well.

If you want to be added, drop me a note at <sjburges@gimp.org>.

Each script will contain a licensing statement in it, describing how it may
be distributed.  A handful are believed to be GPL, but the author hasn't 
been able to be contacted.

Also, most scripts in the examples directory are not described or
documented here. See their source for more info.

example-fu.pl
        An example Gimp::Fu script. This shows every widget Gimp::Fu 
	offers, but doesn't do much useful otherwise.

example-oo.pl
	A small nonsense extension just showing the object-oriented
	pdb syntax. 

example-net.pl
	a small nonsense extension showing a bare-bones networked script.

webify.pl
	a small plugin that flattens an image, makes the background
	transparent, converts it to indexed and then crops it
	to the right size. Useful to save small & transparent gifs
	from a higher-quality source. It also features several 
	Gimp::Fu UI-elements.

windify.pl
	Blows your image in a direction, using the Displace filter.

prep4gif.pl
	Will create a copy of your image prepared for saving
	as indexed gif. It will create a border around the non-alpha
	sections of your image, so it won't look jaggy on a background.

gimp-make-img-map
	"This program is an automatic way of scaling and tiling lots of
	images in order to create an index image."

http://www.ualberta.ca/~cwant/gimp/postprocess.html
	Using Gimp-Perl for animation post-processing; some very neat effects 
	produced here.

http://bbgallery.sourceforge.net/
	Gimp-Perl usage to create thumbnail gallerys.  No idea if its supported
	for Gimp-Perl 2.0 or not.

	Dov Grobgeld's excellent intro to Gimp-Perl, updated for 2.0
