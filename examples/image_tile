=head1 NAME

image_tile - Tile images to form a larger image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

<Image>/Filters/Map/Image Tile...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Re-create an image by tiling many sub-images which are in turn chosen
for their likeness to a part of the original.

In other words, you give C<image_tile> a base image and a list of
directories to find other images in. It then tiles small versions of
the images over the original image in such a way that you can still make
out the original if you squint hard enough.

Functions a little like the Filters/Artistic/Mosaic plugin, but with
images as the tiles.

Options:

=over 5

=item Number of tiles

The number of tiles in the X and Y directions must be given. This is the
number of sub-images that will be tiled across and down your original image.

=item Number of cells

In each tile, the image tiler will sample color areas to determine a match.
The more color areas you sample, the more accurate the match, but this also
increases memory, disk and time usage. The default of 4 cells in each direction
is good for most tiling which is meant to be viewed on-line. Print-quality
tiling will have to use more samples to get even finer details right.

=item Duplicate weight

This is a number from 0 to 100 (actually, there is no real upper bound, but
100 is a practical upper limit). This is a weight applied to each sub-image
each time it has been selected. Thus, if you use a hight weight, images
will tend to be chosen only once. If you use a low weight, images will be
chosen as many times as they happen to be the best fit. A weight of 0 will lead
to the most accurate match, but due to the repetition of some images, you
may find the resulting image to be difficult to make out.

=item Sub-Image directories

This is a space-separated list of the directories in which The Gimp will
be able to load sub-images. You may use B<csh>-style file "globing" such
as C</tmp/images/image_dir_*> or C</mnt/cdrom/images_[1234]>.

=item Delete cached image samples

This toggle button will tell the image tiler whether or not to delete the
cached image samples that it creates while reading the sub-images. If you
are planning to attempt matching these sub-images against this base image
again (say, adding a few new files, or brightening the base image first),
you will probably want to keep them around, as the time savings is
huge. However, since these samples are based on aspect ratio and number
of cells, you cannot re-use the samples if you change the number of tiles
or number of cells. Sorry.

=back

=head1 LIMITATIONS

B<image_tile> requires a large number of image to work from. This is because
it needs to divide up your original image and for each tile, find another
image which looks like that tile. This can require anywhere from 2000 to tens
of thousands of component images.

image_tile will use as much disk space as is required to store the sampling
information that it creates for each of the sub images. However, its use of
memory is much more conservative. The assumption being that a lot more people
have a Gig of disk free than a Gig of RAM. So, expect a large file to be
created in your .gimp directory (you can select automatic cleanup of this
file if you wish).

=head1 IMAGE TYPES

*

=head1 BUGS

Most of the I<bugs> in the image tiler are actually just design limitations.
For example:

=over 5

=item *

The images must all be the same aspect ratio, so B<image_tile> will crop them
to match the target aspect ratio. Because of the large number of images
involved, it is impractical to specify a crop area for each one, so the
center of the image is chosen.

=item *

If The Gimp library were multi-threaded the image tiler would read more than
one sub-image at a time.

=item *

Directory selection is crude. Gimp needs a file/directory selection model for
plug-ins similar to the color selection model.

=item *

If some of your sub-images are bad, the image tiler will display an error
message when trying to load them. This can result in a I<lot> of messages
for a multi-thousand image database.

=item *

URLs should be handled as image directories.

=item *

Some text describing what image directory is being searched would be nice, but
this would require more code than I want to write right now.

=head1 HISTORY

  TODO:
	o Fix undo
	o Handle input drawable correctly (for working on selections)
	o Find faster ways to sample sub-images.
	o More control over cropping
	o Scaling vs cropping of sub-images
	o Better color matching algorithms
	o Test (fix?) non-interactive use...
	o Allow tile aspect selection independant of base image
 
  DONE:
        o 04-22-2001, peter@kirchgessner.net: fix problems with functions
          that changed number of arguments
