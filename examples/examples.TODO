'testall' is a script to test each script via the PDB.

Problem scripts right now are:

Scripts that require more than 1 layer - haven't implemented tests yet.
TeX-to-float - just hangs when called.  Unknown why (works ok interactively)
image_tile: I don't have a suffient gallery to test this with; anyone have a 
few thousand pics to throw at this and let me know if it works?
