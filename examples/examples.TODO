Remove or fix:

alpha2color: oh-my-god ugly.  Color specifiers not 1.3 compatibile.  In a lousy menu spot.  Just remove this one, since its simple to do by hand anyway. 
border: broken; probably color speicifiers, but hard to tell without learning PDL a lot better.  May be my color conversion routine in Fu.pm is broken too.
circular_text: polar coordinates does a better job, more flexibly, and with preview.  
colourtoalpha: this algorithm isn't right.  There's a C plugin that does it right.  Get rid of this.
Create_Images (leaning towards removal, along with the file "image_list", since it doesn't do much)
fire: gradient selector broken
fit-text: doesn't work due to differences in fonts; xlfd_szie no longer works, because we don't have an xlfd any longer.  Can the font widget do better in returning values?
gimpmagick: <sjburges@gimp.org> gtk2 rework - needs preview->gdk::pixbuf conversion.  Crashes in imagemagick now (using version 5.5.7.9) with : Exception 410: No images defined (AddNoise) at /home/seth/.gimp-1.3/plug-ins/gimpmagick line 257.  Or unable to open temporary file, if you instead click "apply".  Also one of the uglier guis ever to grace gimp.

PDB: <sjburges@gimp.org> working on this; major gtk2 rework, probably change quite a bit to make the gui a bit more accessible
logulator: the name is awful, and its not working very well; pdb errors all over.  This useful enough to keep?
roundrectsel: redundant, remove this
terral_text: xlfd problems

Tested:
bricks: 2/25/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> lots of changes (see plugin).  This seems to work now, with a bit of work that could be done by anyone with an intrest.
burst: 12/6/03 <sjburges@gimp.org>  basic functionality works
fade-alpha: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> removed deprecated stuff, so works again.  2/29/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> s/blend/edit_blend/
centerguide: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> works. (Gimp-Fu is ugly for radio buttons)
dots: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> works.  (Gimp-Fu is ugly for color selectors, and for spinbuttons)  Needs to be added to the install list.
dust: 2/25/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> its more worm-like than dust-like, but it works (I think it does what its supposed to?).  I removed deprecated stuff, including fixing Util.pm.
feedback: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> works; don't know how useful it is still.
glowing_steel: 12/13/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> fixed. 12/26/03 fixed again (color specifiers 0-1.0) 2/07/04  fixed again (s/bucket_fill/edit_bucket_fill/g)
guide_remove: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> works.
guidegrid: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> works
innerbevel: 12/13/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> fixed. 2/29/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> s/blend/edit_blend/
layerfuncs: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> Center Layer works.  Probably could use repositioning in menus.  Could use a namechange since I removed the layer_to_image_size functionality, which is ported to C.
map_to_gradient: 2/25/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> added param to gradients_get data.  Works, but its identical to Filters/Color/Map/Map Gradient in C.  Its a good example because it shows off the Gradient selector and PDL, but its bad in that it reimplements something already shipped with gimp.  I'm thinking of not installing this by default...
mirrorsplit: 2/25/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> s/undo_push/undo/, have to add a layer to flip/select it in current gimp; removed when done w/ it.  Changed enums to be &Gimp::*.  fixed.
prep4gif: 2/25/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> s/layer_set_visible/drawable_set_visible/.  fixed.
perlotine: 12/13/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> fixed; tested on gif only.
randomart1: 12/13/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> fixed; could use spinners instead of sliders.  2/29/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> s/blend/edit_blend/
randomblends: 12/13/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> fixed. 2/29/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> s/blend/edit_blend/
roundsel: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> works.
sethspin: 12/13/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> fixed.
triangle: 2/25/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> works.  Not installed by default.
warp-sharp: 3/06/04 <sjburges@gimp.org> fixed.  plug_in_edge changed, s/undo_push/undo/.
windify: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> works.
xachlego: 12/14/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> removed deprecated; works.
xachshadow: 12/14/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> removed deprecated, added a selection->none.  works.
xachvision: 12/14/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> fixed.  Changed orientation to be horizontal.
yinyang: 12/12/03 <sjburges@gimp.org> basic functionality works <2/20/04> s/gimp_bucket_fill/gimp_edit_bucket_fill/g
