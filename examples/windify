=head1 HISTORY

 sent to me by Seth Burgess <sjburges@gimp.org>
 small changes my Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>
 2014/03/17 ported to GIMP 2.8.10 by Ed J:
   - I think the fill with the foreground colour should be background
     since that's the colour expressly set, but didn't touch
   - adjusted the maths so inputs are in degrees

 There's corruption on the edges of this in smear mode.  Yuck.
