NAME

       Gimp - Perl extension for writing Gimp Extensions/Plug-ins/Load &
       Save-Handlers

WARNING

       This version of the module is highly experimental and only works
       for gimp-1.3 CVS (as of 12/12/03) or higher.

       Current limitations:

       - init callback has been disabled
       - most things using gtk don't work

SYNOPSIS

       my $img = new Image (600, 300, RGB);
       my $bg = $img->layer_new(600,300,RGB_IMAGE,"Background",100,NORMAL_MODE);
       $img->add_layer($bg, 1);
       $img->edit_fill($bg);
       $img->display_new;
       
       A complete & documented example script can be found at the end of
       this document (search for EXAMPLE).

DOCUMENTATION

       The Manpages in html format, the newest version, links and more
       information can be found on the gimp-perl homepage, where you
       should get an overview over the gimp-perl extension:

       http://gimp.pages.de/
       -or-
       http://www.goof.com/pcg/marc/gimp.html
       
PREREQUISITES

       To install/use this perl extension, you need to have the following
       software packages installed (the given order is best):

       Perl5.008 (or higher):

          While this extension might run with perl 5.6, I do not support
          nor encourage it in any way.

       The GNU Image Manipulation Program, i.e. The GIMP:
       http://www.gimp.org/
       ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/

          gimp-1.3 (or newer, e.g. CVS or CVS snapshots) is required.  For
          older versions of The Gimp, use version 1.2* of the Gimp-Pelr
          module.

       Gtk, the perl extension for gtk+2
       http://gtk2-perl.sourceforge.net

          The special "gtk2-perl-xs" variant is required, the inline
          version is *NOT* supported. Releases (as on CPAN) may work.

       PDL, the Perl Data Language
       http://www.cpan.org/

          Optionally, you can install the PDL module to be able to
          manipulate pixel data (or to be able to run the example plug-ins
          that do pixel manipulation). PDL is available at any CPAN
          mirror, version 2.4 or higher is recommended. Without PDL,
          some plug-ins do not work (they will not be installed), 
	  and accessing raw image data is impossible.

INSTALLATION

       On unix, you should be able to run "perl Makefile.PL" make, make
       test && make install. To get a listing of configuration options,
       enter

       perl ./Makefile.PL --help
       
       a straight "perl Makefile.PL" should do the job on most systems,
       but watch out for warnings. If everything went fine, enter "make",
       "make test", "make install".

       After installation, these perl plug-ins should be visible from
       within the Gimp (and many, many more):

       <Toolbox>/Xtns/Perl Control Center
       <Toolbox>/Xtns/Perl-Server
       <Image>/Filters/Artistic/Windify
       <Image>/Filters/Misc/Prepare for GIF
       <Image>/Filters/Misc/Webify
       
       If you don't have unix, you can install linux instead
       (http://www.linux.org/)

OVERWRITING INSTALL LOCATIONS (PREFIX)

       In the rare case that you want to install the Gimp-Perl modules
       somewhere else than in the standard location then there is a
       standard way to accomplish this.

       Usually, you can just use the PREFIX=/path option to the
       Makefile.PL, or the other common solution of adding the INST* path
       definitions onto the "make install" commandline.

       These options are described in the "perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker"
       manpage.

       If you are configuring the gimp-pelr module that comes with the
       Gimp sourcetree this won't work. In that case you can set the
       environment variable:

       PERL_MM_OPT='whatever options you want to pass to MakeMaker'

       before running configure. The arguments that you put into that
       variable will be passed to the Makefile.PL as if given on the
       commandline.

       If you are building a slp/deb/rpm/whatever package you usually want
       to use the normal prefix, while overwriting the prefix at "make
       install" time. In that case, just build gimp-perl (or the whole
       gimp) as usual, but instead of just calling "make install", use
       something like the following command (this example is for debian):

          make prefix=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr PREFIX=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr \
               install
       
       The lowercase prefix is used by the Gimp, the uppercase PREFIX is
       used by perl.  Rarely you also want to specifiy manpage directories
       etc.. you can also overwrite these (see "man ExtUtils::MakeMaker")
       as well, e.g. for debian:

          make prefix=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr PREFIX=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr \
               INSTALLMAN1DIR=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr/man/man1 \
               INSTALLMAN3DIR=`pwd`/debian/tmp/usr/man/man3 \
               install

SUPPORT/MAILING LISTS/MORE INFO

       subscribe, send a mail with the single line

       subscribe
       
       to gimp-perl-request@lists.netcentral.net.

       (do these still work?)

       If you want to get notified of new versions automatically, send a

       subscribe notify-gimp

       You can also upload your scripts to the gimp registry at
       http://registry.gimp.org/.  
       
       If you think your script is of general intrest, please let 
       <sjburges@gimp.org> know and it will be considered for 
       inclusion in future Gimp module releases.

BLURB

       GIMP's interface to scheme it makes script development an exercise 
       in pain, having written a few myself.  Reasonable error reporting,
       ability to glue outside programs in, and an (overly) full featured
       set of language operators are all things that make the Gimp module
       preferable to me.  

       There is also a python module included with Gimp now.  If you like
       python, knock yourself out; I'm sticking with perl for awhile.

LICENSE

       The gimp-perl module is currently available under the GNU Public
       License (see COPYING.GPL for details) and the Artistic License (see
       COPYING.Artistic for details). Many of the scripts in the example
       section follow these rules, but some of them have a different
       licensing approach, please consult their source for more info.

THREATS

       Future versions of this package might be distributed under the
       terms of the GPL only, to be consistent with the rest of the
       Gimp. Andreas keeps me from doing this, though.
