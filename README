NAME
       Gimp - Perl extension for writing Gimp Extensions/Plug-
       ins/Load & Save-Handlers

SYNOPSIS
       my $img = new Image (600, 300, RGB);
       my $bg = $img->layer_new(600,300,RGB_IMAGE,"BAckground",100,NOTMAL_MODE);
       $img->add_layer($bg, 1);
       $img->edit_fill($bg);
       $img->display_new;

DOCUMENTATION
       The Manpages in html format, the newest version and other
       information can be found on the Gimp-perl homepage, where
       you should get an overview over the Gimp-perl extension:
       
       http://www.goof.com/pcg/marc/gimp.html
       
       Dov Grobgeld has written a nice tutorial as well, you
       can find it at:
       
       http://imagic.weizmann.ac.il/~dov/gimp/perl-tut.html

PREREQUISITES
       To install/use this perl extension, you need to have the
       following software packages installed installed:
       
       Perl5.005_02 (or higher):
       While this extension should run fine with older versions (it has been
       tested with 5.004_04), I get many unreproducable bug reports with
       5.004 that I don't get with 5.005. When in doubt, upgrade.
       
       The GNU Image Manipulation Program, i.e. The GIMP:
       ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/
       
       GTK+, the X11 toolkit:
       ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk/
       
       Gtk, the perl extension for the above:
       ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk/perl/
       
       Optionally, you can install PDL (the perl data language), to easily
       manipulate pixel data. PDL is available at any CPAN mirror, version
       1.9906 or higher is recommended.
       
       General Information about The Gimp can be found at
       http://www.gimp.org/

INSTALLATION
       On unix, you should be able to run "perl Makefile.PL"
       make, make test && make install. To get a listing
       of configuration options, enter
       
       perl ./Makefile.PL --help
       
       a straight "perl Makefile.PL" should do the job on most systems, but
       watch out for warnings. If everything went fine, enter "make", "make
       test", "make install" and, if you want to install the Perl-Server and
       some other plug-ins, "make install-plugins"
       
       After installation, these perl plug-ins should be visible from with
       The Gimp:
       
       <Toolbox>/Xtns/Perl-Server
       <Image>/Filters/Artistic/Windify
       <Image>/Filters/Misc/Prepare for GIF
       <Image>/Filters/Misc/Webify
       
       If you don't have unix, you can install linux instead
       (http://www.linux.org)

       Scheme is the crappiest language ever. Have a look at Haskell
       (http://www.haskell.org) to see how functional is done right.
